# Wish List

Various things that seem like they might be "nice to have".

## Turn Off Microphone at Boot

Currently having to do this manually.  Seems inevitable that I'm going
to forget.

## Policy Checker

A "policy checker" to confirm that things like "microphone is off"
hold, no network services are running, etc. would be nice to have.

Better would be for this to run periodically and report on status?
