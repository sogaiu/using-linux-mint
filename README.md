# Using Linux Mint

Notes on setting up and using Linux Mint.

The content was originally a gist, but it became unwieldy to edit so I
decided to rearrange it in the form of an ordinary git repository.

## Background

Void was good, but I didn't find it was practical for me to get an
idea of where things were going nor what the current status happened
to be (e.g. if many folks were experiencing some issue due to a
change).  It looked like to get any sense of what was going on that
one would need to have decent IRC access and that's not something I've
figured out how to do satisfactorily.

Linux Mint is something I've used before (though quite a while back)
and being Ubuntu-based not too unfamiliar because Debian was one of
the first Linuxish systems I used.

Would be nice if LMDE became the main thing and unfortunate that Mint
uses systemd, but one can't have everything I suppose...
